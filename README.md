# Team Tracker
## Week 12 Challenge

When creating an open-source project on GitHub, itâ€™s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributionsâ€”this last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project. With this application, you can quickly and easily generate a README file by using a command-line process to create the start of a perfect readme.
